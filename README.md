Extention of GenBank Parser

Three new methods added to last weeks homework.

3) Method extracts and returns the genes and their exons for this sequence.
4) Method filters the sequence in the ORIGIN field, converts it to a string of base sequences by removing line numbers, white spaces (new lines in the sequence are removed as well), and gaps (‘n’), and prints the string.
5) The fifth method calculates and returns the GC content of the sequence in the ORIGIN field.
